# Contacts App

## Overview

This project is a simple contact management app built using React and React Router, following the official [React Router Tutorial](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial). The app demonstrates the fundamental features of React Router, including routing, navigation, and handling data through loaders and actions.

## Features

- **Routing:** Utilises React Router for page navigation, with nested routes to manage different views within the app.
- **Data Loading:** Asynchronous data fetching using React Router's loader function.
- **Form Handling:** Form submissions and data updates are managed with React Router's Form component and action function.
- **Search Functionality:** Includes a search bar to filter contacts dynamically.
- **Navigation State:** Visual feedback for loading states during navigation.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** Utilised for building the user interface, enabling component-based architecture, and managing state across the application.
- **React Router:** Handles client-side routing, allowing for seamless navigation between different pages and components in the app.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** Employed for writing modern, concise code, including async/await for handling asynchronous operations like data fetching.
- **HTML5 & CSS3:** Used for structuring and styling the application, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing design.
- **Custom Hooks:** Implemented to encapsulate reusable logic, such as handling form submissions and managing navigation states.
- **Vite:** Chosen as the development server and build tool, providing fast reload times and optimized bundling for a smoother development experience.
- **Fake Data API:** A simulated backend for fetching and managing contact data, mimicking real-world API interactions.
